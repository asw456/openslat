### Earthquake Engineering Value-At-Risk SaaS

This software calculates the financial and life-safety risk for commercial buildings in New Zealand, part of the design and risk assessment process for new buildings. This project is also a proof-of-concept in converting research to a usable tool as quickly and flexibly as possible.

### Features
* SaaS implementation or self-contained cross-platform application
* Java calculation server, job submission and results access via. REST api (this project)
* AngularJS/websocket browser client (https://github.com/statX/openslat-ui)

This project brings leading earthquake engineering research to an educational and consulting setting through a simple and flexible user interface coupled to a server-based or local computation engine. A local mode is available.
 
### Components 
* [The OpenSLAT interface] (https://github.com/statX/openslat-nodejs-one)
